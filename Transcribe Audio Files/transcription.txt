What's going on guys welcome back in this file today we're going to learn about the python package that allows us to automatically find all modules and packages that are used in a project and to automatically create a requirements txt file based on that so let us get right into it. Alright so for this file today I'm going to be working on Linux however all of this works on windows in the same way and I assume also on Mac because the python package that we're going to use in this file is plateform independent and the name of this package is pip wrecks so basically pip requirements and we can install it by saying pip threee or pip depending on your operating system and installation. Install pip wreckslike this in my case already installed and this package allows us to automatically createa requirements txt file based on packages and modules used in a code base so not on whate we have installed so it's not like saying pip frees in an environment getting use this file and get more than benefites.
